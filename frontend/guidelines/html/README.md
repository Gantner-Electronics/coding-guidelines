# General Guidelines

At this stage we are going to adapt HTML Guidelines from GBE developer teams. Which can be found in GBE Confluence (https://confluence.gantner.com/x/2aGvD).

To make the process easier we are introducing HTMLHint (https://htmlhint.com) a Static Code Analysis Tool which checks the defined rules. You can find the configuration file below.
